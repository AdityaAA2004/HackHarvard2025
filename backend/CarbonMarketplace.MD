# 🌍 Carbon Credit Marketplace - Innovation Feature

## 🎯 Overview

The **Carbon Credit Marketplace** is an intelligent compliance system that automatically detects when shipping routes exceed emission thresholds and recommends optimal carbon credit purchases to achieve regulatory compliance.

## 💡 The Problem We Solve

Traditional logistics optimization focuses on cost and speed. However, modern supply chains face:
- **Regulatory Limits**: EU ETS, California CARB mandate emission caps
- **Compliance Penalties**: Heavy fines for exceeding thresholds
- **Manual Procurement**: Companies struggle to buy carbon credits efficiently

## 🚀 Our Solution

**Automated Carbon Credit Marketplace Integration**

When a route exceeds emission limits:
1. **Policy Agent** detects threshold violation
2. Calculates exact overage (e.g., 200kg over limit)
3. Searches carbon credit marketplace
4. Recommends optimal credit based on user priority
5. Auto-calculates total compliant cost
